<!-- Welcome Interface page -->
<h3>Welcome Interface (Home):</h3>
<p>The goal of designing the "Home" page is to simplify absence management by displaying information about recent absences in a user-friendly manner, including the date, employee name, and status (present/absent). To this end, the interface includes two dropdown menus allowing users to filter absences by status (present, absent, all) and to choose a specific date or select "All dates." A "Search" button is available to initiate the search using the chosen criteria, and a search function is in place to filter the data accordingly, ensuring a user-friendly experience.</p>

<h3>Teacher Interface (Teachers):</h3>
<p>The "Teacher" interface is designed to manage teacher information. It offers essential functionalities such as adding a teacher with details like name, national identification number, phone number, email address, and specialty. Additionally, the interface provides an "Update" button to modify the teacher's status, making them active or inactive based on their presence. A "Delete" button allows for the removal of a teacher who leaves the institution, and the super administrator can access the teacher's password. This interface simplifies the management of teachers within the educational institution while ensuring secure access to sensitive information.</p>
