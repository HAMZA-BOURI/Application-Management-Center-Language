<H2>Manager Account</H2>
<!-- Connection interface Page -->
<h3>Connection interface (Manager Account):</h3>
<p>This figure represents the first page that is displayed to the user responsible for verifying their information and redirecting them to the appropriate page based on their type of responsibility. It is the first page that appears after the program is executed and corresponds to the login window for the responsible user.</p>

<!-- Welcome Interface page -->
<h3>Welcome Interface (Home):</h3>
<p>The goal of designing the "Home" page is to simplify absence management by displaying information about recent absences in a user-friendly manner, including the date, employee name, and status (present/absent). To this end, the interface includes two dropdown menus allowing users to filter absences by status (present, absent, all) and to choose a specific date or select "All dates." A "Search" button is available to initiate the search using the chosen criteria, and a search function is in place to filter the data accordingly, ensuring a user-friendly experience.</p>

<!-- Contact Page -->
<h3>Teacher Interface (Teachers):</h3>
<p>The "Teacher" interface is designed to manage teacher information. It offers essential functionalities such as adding a teacher with details like name, national identification number, phone number, email address, and specialty. Additionally, the interface provides an "Update" button to modify the teacher's status, making them active or inactive based on their presence. A "Delete" button allows for the removal of a teacher who leaves the institution, and the super administrator can access the teacher's password. This interface simplifies the management of teachers within the educational institution while ensuring secure access to sensitive information.</p>

<!-- Class Interface Page -->
<h3>Class Interface (Class):</h3>
<H5><p>
The class interface is designed to display crucial information such as the name, schedule, level, language, and teacher for each class. It includes labels for each class detail and a ComboBox for selecting an existing class. Three buttons, "Add," "Update," and "Delete," facilitate the management of classes, whether for adding new classes, updating information, or deleting classes. Additionally, another ComboBox can be used to assign a teacher to an existing class or choose a new one if the current teacher leaves the class. Implementing data management logic is essential to ensure the interface is consistent with your database or information system.

<!-- Student Interface -->
<h3>Student Interface (STUDENTS):</h3>
<H5><p>
The 'Student' interface has been developed to facilitate the management of student information. It offers essential functionalities such as adding a student with details like name, phone number, email address, and class assignment. Additionally, this interface provides an 'Update' button to modify the student's class assignment, making them active or inactive based on their enrollment status. A 'Delete' button allows for the removal of a student who leaves the institution. This interface simplifies student management within the educational institution while ensuring secure access to sensitive information.

<!-- Absence Interface -->
<h3>Absence Interface (Absence):</h3>
<H5><p>
The "Absence" interface is designed to manage the display of absences and present students, offering functionalities such as adding new absences and presences. However, it does not allow for a single student to be displayed with both "absent" and "present" statuses simultaneously. This interface aims to simplify the management of attendance data for students in an educational or professional context. It provides an efficient solution for tracking student attendance and managing absence cases while ensuring data consistency by preventing the dual assignment of "absent" and "present" statuses to the same student.

<!-- End of Study Interface -->
<h3>End of Study Interface (End Study):</h3>
<H5><p>
The 'End of Study' interface is designed to perform daily updates by comparing each student's end-of-study date with the current execution date. Its primary role is to identify students whose end-of-study date matches the current date, and then display them. This operation is carried out daily to ensure real-time tracking of students finishing within the deadlines. This interface is particularly useful in educational or project management environments, where it's crucial to ensure that students or participants complete their studies or projects according to predefined dates. It helps identify those who successfully meet deadlines and can be used to take additional measures if necessary, such as awarding degrees or managing rewards for those who finish on time.
